dice is a terminal client for redis with auto-completion and syntax
highlighting. dice lets you type Redis commands smoothly, and displays results
in a user-friendly format.

dice is an alternative for redis-cli. In most cases, dice behaves exactly
the same as redis-cli. Besides, it is safer to use dice on production servers
than redis-cli: dice will prevent accidentally running dangerous commands,
like `KEYS *` (see
[Redis docs / Latency generated by slow commands](https://redis.io/topics/latency#latency-generated-by-slow-commands)).

## Features

- Advanced code completion. If you run command `KEYS` then run `DEL`, dice
  will auto-complete your command based on `KEYS` result.
- Command validation. dice will validate command while you are typing, and
  highlight errors. E.g. try `CLUSTER MEET IP PORT`, dice will validate IP and
  PORT for you.
- Command highlighting, fully based on redis grammar. Any valid command in
  dice shell is a valid redis command.
- Human-friendly result display.
- _pipeline_ feature, you can use your favorite shell tools to parse redis'
  response, like `get json | jq .`.
- Support pager for long output.
- Support connection via URL, `dice --url redis://example.com:6379/1`.
- Support cluster, dice will auto reissue command for `MOVED` response in
  cluster mode.
- Store server configuration: `dice -d prod-redis` (see [dsn](#using-dsn) for
  more).
- `peek` command to check the key's type then automatically call
  `get`/`lrange`/`sscan`, etc, depending on types. You don't need to call the
  `type` command then type another command to get the value. `peek` will also
  display the key's length and memory usage.
- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> to cancel the current typed command, this won't
  exit dice, exactly like bash behaviour. Use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd>
  to send a EOF to exit dice.
- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> to open **reverse-i-search** to search through
  your command history.
- Auto suggestions. (Like [fish shell](http://fishshell.com/).)
- Support `--encode=utf-8`, to decode Redis' bytes responses.
- Command hint on bottom, include command syntax, supported redis version, and
  time complexity.
- Official docs with built-in `HELP` command, try `HELP SET`!
- Written in pure Python, but dice was packaged into a single binary with
  [PyOxidizer](https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer), you can use cURL to
  download and run, it just works, even you don't have a Python interpreter.
- You can change the cli prompt using `--prompt` option or set via `~/.dicerc`
  config file.
- Hide password for `AUTH` command.
- Says "Goodbye!" to you when you exit!

## Install

### Pip

Install via pip:

```
pip install dice
```

[pipx](https://github.com/pipxproject/pipx) is recommended:

```
pipx install dice
```

### Brew

For Mac users, you can install dice via brew üçª

```
brew install dice
```

### Linux

You can also use your Linux package manager to install dice, like `apt` in
Ubuntu (Only available on Ubuntu 21.04+).

```shell
apt install dice
```

[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/dice.svg)](https://repology.org/project/dice/versions)

### Download Binary

Or you can download the executable binary with cURL(or wget), untar, then run.
It is especially useful when you don't have a python interpreter(E.g. the
[official Redis docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis/) which doesn't
have Python installed.):

```
wget  https://github.com/dicedb/cli/releases/latest/download/dice.tar.gz \
 && tar -xzf dice.tar.gz \
 && ./dice
```

(Check the [release page](https://github.com/dicedb/cli/releases) if you
want to download an old version of dice.)

## Usage

Once you install dice, you will know how to use it. Just remember, dice
supports similar options like redis-cli, like `-h` for redis-server's host and
`-p` for port.

```
$ dice --help

Usage: dice [OPTIONS] [CMD]...

  dice: Interactive Redis

  When no command is given, dice starts in interactive mode.

                                  with env `dice_URL`), Example:     redis:/
                                  /[[username]:[password]]@localhost:6379/0

                                  `dice_DSN`)

                                  STDOUT is not a tty). However, you can use
                                  --no-raw to force formatted output even when

                                  {username}, {client_addr}, {client_id}).

  --help                          Show this message and exit.

```

### Using DSN

dice support storing server configuration in config file. Here is a DSN
config:

```
[alias_dsn]
dev=redis://localhost:6379/4
staging=redis://username:password@staging-redis.example.com:6379/1
```

Put this in your `dicerc` then connect via `dice -d staging` or
`dice -d dev`.

### Change The Default Prompt

You can change the prompt str, the default prompt is:

```shell
127.0.0.1:6379>
```

Which is rendered by `{host}:{port}[{db}]> `, you can change this via `--prompt`
option or change
[dicerc](https://github.com/dicedb/cli/blob/master/dice/data/dicerc)
config file. The prompwt string uses python string format engine, supported
interpolations:

- `{client_name}`
- `{db}`
- `{host}`
- `{path}`
- `{port}`
- `{username}`
- `{client_addr}`
- `{client_id}`

The `--prompt` utilize
[Python String format engine](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#formatstrings),
so as long as it is a valid string formatter, it will work( anything that
`"<your prompt>".format(...)` accepts). For example, you can limit your Redis
server host name's length to 5 by setting `--prompt` to
`dice --prompt '{host:.5s}'`.

### Configuration

dice supports config files. Command-line options will always take precedence
over config. Configuration resolution from highest to lowest precedence is:

- _Options from command line_
- `$PWD/.dicerc`
- `~/.dicerc` (this path can be changed with `dice --dicerc $YOUR_PATH`)
- `/etc/dicerc`
- default config in dice package.

You can copy the _self-explained_ default config here:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dicedb/cli/master/dice/data/dicerc

And then make your own changes.

(If you are using an old versions of dice, please use the config file below,
and change the version in URL):

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dicedb/cli/v1.0.4/dice/data/dicerc

### Keys

dice support unix/readline-style REPL keyboard shortcuts, which means keys
like <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd> to forward work.

Also:

- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd> (i.e. EOF) to exit; you can also use the `exit`
  command.
- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>L</kbd> to clear screen; you can also use the `clear`
  command.
- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>X</kbd> <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>E</kbd> to open an
  editor to edit command, or <kbd>V</kbd> in vi-mode.

## Development

### Release Strategy

dice is built and released by `GitHub Actions`. Whenever a tag is pushed to
the `master` branch, a new release is built and uploaded to pypi.org, it's very
convenient.

Thus, we release as often as possible, so that users can always enjoy the new
features and bugfixes quickly. Any bugfix or new feature will get at least a
patch release, whereas big features will get a minor release.

### Setup Environment

dice favors [poetry](https://github.com/sdispater/poetry) as package
management tool. To setup a develop environment on your computer:

First, install poetry (you can do it in a python's virtualenv):

```
pip install poetry
```

Then run (which is similar to `pip install -e .`):

```
poetry install
```

**Be careful running testcases locally, it may flush you db!!!**

### Development Logs

This is a command-line tool, so we don't write logs to stdout.

You can `tail -f ~/.dice.log` to see logs, the log is pretty clear, you can
see what actually happens from log files.

### Catch Up with Latest Redis-doc

dice use a git submodule to track current-up-to-date redis-doc version. To
catch up with latest:

1. Git pull in redis-doc
2. Copy doc files to `/data`: `cp -r redis-doc/commands* dice/data`
3. Prettier
   markdown`prettier --prose-wrap always dice/data/commands/*.md --write`
4. Check the diff, update dice' code if needed.
